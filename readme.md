## Project Overview
This repository contains our coursework and project files for the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course. Our work includes signal processing techniques, implementation of various DSP algorithms, and practical applications using Python and MATLAB.

## Contents
- `docs/` - Documentation and reports
- `code/` - Source code for DSP implementations
- `datasets/` - Sample data for testing
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `results/` - Outputs and processed signals

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, MATLAB
- **Libraries & Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dsp-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dsp-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the scripts or Jupyter notebooks to explore the implementations.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Use feature branches for new implementations.
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
- Pull requests should be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.

## Contact
