- `results/` - Outputs and processed signals

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, MATLAB
- **Libraries & Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dsp-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dsp-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the scripts or Jupyter notebooks to explore the implementations.

## Contribution Guidelines
